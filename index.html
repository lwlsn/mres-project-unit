      <h1>An MRes Guide to Reading Research Papers</h1>
      <p>To begin the course, we consider how to read a research paper. 
        Later in the term, we will talk about how to write a research paper. 
        This presupposes that you have a good reason to carefully read a research paper, such as if it is relevant to your own research, or perhaps later in your research career if you are asked to review it. 
        We might also later discuss how to skim a paper, so that you can decide whether a paper is worth careful reading.</p>

      <h1>Reading Goals</h1>
      <p>When you read a research paper, your goal is to understand the scientific contributions the authors are making. 
        This is not an easy task. 
        It may require going over the paper several times. 
        Expect to sometimes to even spend several hours to read a paper. 
        Here are some initial guidelines for how to read a paper:

      <h1>Read Critically</h1>
      <p> 
        Reading a research paper must be a critical process. 
        You should not assume that the authors are always correct. 
        Instead, be suspicious. Critical reading involves asking appropriate questions, such as (but not limited to):
     </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the authors attempt to solve a problem, are they solving the right problem?</li>
        <li> Are there simple solutions the authors do not seem to have considered?</li>
        <li>What are the limitations?</li>
        <li>Are assumptions reasonable? Is the logic sound?</li>
        <li>Did they gather and interpret data properly?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div>
      <h1>Read Creatively</h1>
      <p>Reading a paper critically is easier than creatively, in that it is always easier to tear something down than to build it up. 
        Reading creatively involves harder, more positive thinking. .</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the good/interesting ideas in this paper?</li>
        <li>Do these ideas have other applications or extensions that the authors might not have thought of? </li>
        <li>Can they be generalised further?</li>
        <li> Are there possible improvements that might make important practical differences? </li>
        <li>If you continued this research, whatâ€™s next?</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Make Notes As You Read</h1>
      <p>Many people cover the margins of their copies of papers with notes, (depending on what medium you use, this may now be electronic). 
        If you have questions or criticisms, write them down so you do not forget them. 
        Underline key points the authors make. Mark the data that is most important or that appears questionable. 
        Such efforts help the first time you read a paper and pay big dividends when you have to re-read a paper after several months. </p>

      <h1>After You Read Through, Summarise</h1>
      <p>Almost all good research papers try to provide an answer to a specific question. 
        (Sometimes the question is a natural one that people specifically set out to answer; sometimes a good idea just ends up answering a worthwhile question.) 
        If you can succinctly describe a paper, you have probably recognised the question the authors started with and the answer they provide. 
        Once you have focused on the main idea, you can go back and try to outline the paper to gain insight into more specific details. 
        Indeed, if summarising the paper in one or two sentences is easy, go back and try to deepen your outline by summarising the three or four most important sub-points of the main idea.</p>
